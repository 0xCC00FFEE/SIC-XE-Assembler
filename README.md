This assembler is an open-source assembler made on GNU Linux ,to output object SIC/XE files.
It takes a normal text file that contains SIC/XE instructions as input ,and outputs Object code file.
This makes it easy for students to learn ,write and execute SIC/XE binary files with an easy-to-understand assembler.
It also contains a multi-error-displaying functionality ,that can handle multiple kind of errors.
This assembler uses Hashing data structure to process opcodes.
